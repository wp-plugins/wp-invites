####Localization

* English
* Russian - by [Slaffik](http://cosydale.com/)
* Belarusian - by [Marcis Gasuns](http://www.ippavloff.ru/)    
In 2.0 version, localization is messed a bit - I didn't have time to update it. If you need wp-invites in your language - just ask, and I'll make neccessary update.

####Attention!
This plugin only denies new registrations from strangers. If you need to make your blog really private, you should restrict viewing [with Registered-Users-Only-2 plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/registered-users-only-2/) or somewhat alike.
